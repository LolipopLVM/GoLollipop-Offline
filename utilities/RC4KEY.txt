This is the decryption key for the assets.

DomoAnimate/Cartoon Network assets: g0o1a2n3i4m5a6t7e
GoAnimate/Vyond assets: sorrypleasetryagainlater

"Street" is the ONLY theme that's completely decrypted.

Almost all of the assets are encrypted in RC4 (ARCFOUR).

To decrypt (or encrypt), use CyberChef:

https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=RC4(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'sorrypleasetryagainlater'%7D,'Latin1','Latin1') (Modern assets)
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=RC4(%7B'option':'UTF8','string':'g0o1a2n3i4m5a6t7e'%7D,'Latin1','Latin1') (Older assets)

When you save and it prompts you to enter a filename, you MUST replace .dat with .swf or it won't work properly.
